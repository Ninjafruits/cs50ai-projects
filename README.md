# CS50's AI Projects – HarvardX

Welcome to my collection of projects from [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/)!  
This repo showcases AI-powered programs I’ve built using concepts like **search algorithms**, **constraint satisfaction**, **game theory**, and **machine learning**.

These projects focus on **hands-on AI problem solving**, with real Python implementations — no magic black boxes.

*** Note: This is a Harvard's AI course offered on edx.learn using thier incomplete files and instructions -> I implemented my own solution to the code to make it run ***

## 📂 Project List

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`degrees`](./degrees) | Find the shortest chain of co-stars between two actors using **breadth-first search (BFS)** |
(more coming soon!)

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- ✅ Graph search (DFS, BFS)
- ✅ Constraint Satisfaction Problems (AC-3, backtracking)
- ✅ Game playing (Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning)
- ✅ Machine learning: reinforcement learning
- ✅ Probabilistic models: Markov models, Bayes nets
- ✅ Logic and knowledge representation

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

I built this repo to:
- Reinforce core AI concepts through implementation
- Practice Python with real-world problems
- Showcase my progress publicly
- Inspire others learning AI 🧑‍💻
